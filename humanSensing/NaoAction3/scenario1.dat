Good Morning! $name !
It's eight clock in the morning.
Today is a warm and cloudy day
with the maximum temperature 28 degrees 
and minimum temperature 16 degrees.
$name, you have a meeting with Amy from HKUST at 10 o'clock.
Don't forget that.
In that meeting, Amy wants to discuss the hiking activity for this Sunday.
Amy told you yesterday that 
she would like to go to the Clear Water Bay Country Park.
I googled this park for you.
And find some information about that park.
It is a beautiful country park near the Clear Water Bay.
And Clearwater Bay Peninsula is a typical submergent coast.
It is a comfortable starting point for hikers.
And Many come here just to fly kites.
That would all about that park.
You will talk with Amy to decide whether you are going to hike there.
OK! That would be all.
And I just searched on the university webpage and found an important notice for you.
Prof. Park will come to our university to give us a presentation.
The main topic of his presentation is about Deep Learning on Robotics.
Using deep learning to make robots more intelligent is a promising direction.
And I think you would be interested in his presentation.
If you want to attend his talk, I will register for you.
The venue of the presentation is Lecture Hall D.
It would last for two hours.
Don't forget to show up, $name .
So that's all I want to remind you.
Have a nice day! 
Bye bye!
