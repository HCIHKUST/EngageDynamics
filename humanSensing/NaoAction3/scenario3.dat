Aha, Good evening! $name !
It's been a long day!
You have studied a whole day!
Good for you!
You have finished your math homework! $name .
And I submitted your homework in Canvas.
According to the information in Canvas,
your homework would be graded in two days.
I will inform you if I receive any new information from Canvas.
You have already got three A for your assignments.
I think there would be no problem you may get another A for this homework.
This homework is the last one for this course.
You have done a really good job!
Just prepare for your final exam!
Enjoy your study!! $name .
One more thing about tomorrow's classes.
You will have one class in the morning and,
two classes in the afternoon.
The morning class starts from nine o'clock and,
lasts for one hour.
You might need to get up early to catch the school bus.
Also, you have to prepare for your language course presentation in the afternoon.
the presentation should be related to your current research.
It can be paper digest, technology digest, or book digest.
It is up to you to choose the topic. $name .
It must last at least for fifteen minutes.
OK. That's all for today.
Good luck!
Have a nice dream!
Bye bye! $name .
