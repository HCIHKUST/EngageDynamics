 Hello! Nice to see you, $name.
 I am going to remind you recent meeting arrangement.
 You have a meeting schedule on this Tuesday!
 Davis wants to see you at twelve o'clock this Tuesday!
 He wants to talk with you about some designs about our robot system.
 He mentioned he also invited Dr. Wang to join the meeting.
 Dr. Wang is an experienced software engineer.
 He got his PhD degree from Stanford Unviversity.
 And then he joined Microsoft Research Redmond immediately after graduation,
 and worked there for five years as a senior researcher.
 After that, he had been in Goolge as a project manager for three years,
 Davis will introduce Dr. Wang at that meeting.
 $name, you are supposed to prepare for that meeting.
 At least, you have to check his information.
 I have already sent you an email about him.
 OK, that's would be all for the recent meeting arrangement.
 I will remind you again before the meeting.
 Another thing is that recently I have received a lot of complaints from our research partners.
 They complain that
 they cannot log into our new servers.
 They were sure that they typed in the correct usernames and passwords.
 Maybe there are some problems occurred in our servers.
 The same problem happened several weeks before.
 We may need to check our servers in the server room as soon as possible.
 Otherwise the project would be delayed once again,
 we do not have much time left for our remaining work.
 To ensure everything proceed as expected, you are supposed to fix the problem no later than tomorrow.
 OK, if you need any assitants, I can ask for help for you.
 That would be all for today's arrangement.
 Good luck,
 And have a nice day!
 Bye, Bye! $name .
